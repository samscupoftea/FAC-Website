# FAC-Website

## Introduction

This is my website project for my July 2023 Founders and Coders application. It is a culmination of the skills I have learned since I started coding back in late January. The website showcases various elements and features that I have developed, and it serves as my project submission for the application.

## What I Have Made

My website is a simple yet effective responsive design that incorporates several key features:

- Top navigation bar: Smoothly scrolls to different sections of the website when clicked.
- External links: Provides clickable links to my GitHub profile, CodeWars profile, and previous coding projects.
- Dynamic display: The top title section of the website includes a dynamic day, date, and time display using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- About Me section: Utilizes flexbox design to showcase my skills and knowledge in an organized and deliberate way.
- Interactive reasons section: Allows users to explore my reasons for pursuing a career in software development using JavaScript and interactive buttons.
- Projects section: Utilizes flexbox CSS styling techniques to display my projects in project cards with images and clickable links.
- Sam's Record Club: A dynamic table populated by JavaScript object assets, showcasing some of my favorite albums and encouraging visitor interaction.

## How I Made It

I developed the website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in creating the different sections:

- Top navigation bar: Implemented smooth scrolling functionality using JavaScript.
- External links: Created clickable link elements with appropriate URLs.
- Dynamic display: Used JavaScript and DOM manipulation to update the day, date, and time in real-time.
- About Me section: Utilized flexbox design principles to create an organized and visually appealing layout.
- Interactive reasons section: Implemented JavaScript and interactive buttons to display different reasons for choosing software development from an array.
- Projects section: Applied flexbox CSS styling techniques to create project cards with images and clickable links.
- Sam's Record Club: Created a dynamic table populated by JavaScript object assets, incorporating DOM manipulation and JavaScript functions to handle user input and data display.

## Why I Made It

There are several reasons why I decided to create this website:

- Showcase my skills: The website serves as a portfolio to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have acquired since starting my coding journey.
- Creative expression: I wanted to create a visually appealing and interactive website that reflects my passion for software development.
- Highlight previous projects: By including my previous coding projects, I can showcase the range of work I have done and provide links for further exploration.
- Practice and learning: Developing this website allowed me to practice and apply various techniques, such as flexbox design, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript array manipulation.
- Founders and Coders application: This website project is my submission for the Founders and Coders bootcamp application, demonstrating my commitment and dedication to the program.
