			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div class="introText">
			<p>I was born and grew up in a northern seaside town called Cleethorpes. I studied Philosophy at University before going on to work in many fields such as education, local goverment and music. I never imagined that my life be filled with incredible experience and that it would take me all over the world. Below are some key highlights.  </p>

					<h3> Teaching & Travelling </h3>
					
					
						<h5>In 2016, I moved to Cambodia to train as an English teacher before transitioning to live and teach in Bangkok, Thailand for a year. Following my time in Thailand, I successfully applied for South Korea's government teaching program, EPIK, and spent 5 years living and teaching in Busan. I taught English to students at various levels, including elementary school, high school, and adults. Throughout the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, I remained in South Korea, tackling the work logistics and life adjustments that came with it. In 2022, I returned to the UK, bringing with me a wealth of experience as a dedicated educator.</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="Child2">
					<h3> Music </h3>     
					<h5>I am a self-taught musician and producer, specializing in writing my own songs, vocals and guitar. My songs have gained international and national recognition, with some being broadcasted on BBC6 Music Radio. As a musician, I have had incredible opportunities performing at renowned venues across the UK and supporting remarkable artists and bands.</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="Child3">
					<h3> Martial Arts </h3>
					<h5>In 2018, while in South Korea, I began practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under the guidance of Master Park Jun Yung, the first Korean black belt in BJJ. I participated in two national competitions, earning a bronze medal at the Busan Open in 2019. In 2021, I was honored to receive my blue belt from Master Park.	</h5>
